        <p className="about__description">
          My name is Benja, im a programmer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. My
          journey began in may 2021 once I started a programming course in APX
          school, a very fun interactive platform that allows students to make
          progress in their own time.

          Before that i was already interested in the subject, looking up on
          youtube how to code with python with Mosh Hamedi, for instance.

        <p className="about__description">
          I'm a fast learner, when i'm interested in a subject i usually get
          hooked pretty quick, im also very attentive to detail, so you can
          expect the best from me <i>always</i>. I'm easy to deal with, always
          eager to make new friends and connect with people, and im constantly
          trying to get out of my comfort zone and find new challenges.
